## **Hackathon**

#### Description

Given 24 hours, a theme (the 1990s), and a song (Livin' la Vida Loca by Ricky Martin) an application was developed, utilising Scrum/Agile working methodologies and the full scope of tools and methods learned during the course of Academia de Código's bootcamp. Our goal was to create an application where users visiting clubs, bars and other night life establishments could compete in events and challenges to win points and prizes, such as free beverages or free entry into certain establishments. Likewise, users are able to rate each other and their overall score goes up or down depending on other user's ratings.

Greater care was placed towards the backend and functionality of the minimum viable product over the visual aspect, hence why it remains a simple, unoptimised web application.

#### **Disclaimer**

Known issues were never fixed nor further features implemented, the project is considered finished and will not receive further updates. In the spirit of the 24-hour challenge, not even the code was afterwards organised, or cleaned up. I apologise for any inconvenience navigating the project.
